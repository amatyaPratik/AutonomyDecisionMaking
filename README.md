My Gamified implementations of algorithm and techniques in Autonomous systems and decision making.
note: due to some abilities(powers/properties) of some agents/characters in the game, the environment is not entirely deterministic

Braches are named according to different techniques applied to achieve autonomy:
1. main: Interactive game - base for setting up environment.
2. det-env-dqn-learning: Deep Q leaning in a deterministic environment
3. det-env-oop: Object oriented approach to implementing the environment
4. det-env-q-learning: Q leaning in a deterministic environment
