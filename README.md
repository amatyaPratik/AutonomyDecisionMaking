My Gamified (Pokémon) implementation of algorithms and techniques in Autonomous systems and decision making.

The game: You (as 'Ash') try to find and rescue captive Pikachu https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643515323/13422/pikachu-lie.gif?1643515323 but there are characters (obstacles) who act as adversaries ☠️.
More score 💯 for finding him in the shorted number of steps and without taking unrewarding or harmful paths.  👏🏁

note: 
- due to some abilities(powers/properties) of some agents/characters in the game, the environment is not entirely deterministic
- Please setup the required packages before running the game. Enjoy! 🤗

Braches are named according to different techniques applied to achieve autonomy:
1. main: Interactive game - base for setting up environment.
2. det-env-dqn-learning: Deep Q leaning in a deterministic environment
3. det-env-oop: Object oriented approach to implementing the environment
4. det-env-q-learning: Q leaning in a deterministic environment
